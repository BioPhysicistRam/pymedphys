Overview

PyMedPhys ships with a graphical user interface (GUI). If you've already
installed `pymedphys` (see `Getting Started`_), you can start the GUI by
typing the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

.. code:: bash

    pymedphys gui

Streamlit
*********

The GUI is powered by `Streamlit <https://streamlit.io>`__. Streamlit is
relatively new and is undergoing rapid development. Therefore each PyMedPhys
version, for the time being, will pin to a specific Streamlit version. This
version restriction will be removed once the Streamlit APIs used by PyMedPhys
stabilise.
