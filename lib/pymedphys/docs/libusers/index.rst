Overview
======================

Resources to assist users of the PyMedPhys library. If you're experienced with
Python but brand new to PyMedPhys, `start here`_.

The **Library Users Guide** is separated into following sub-categories:

- *Tutorials*

  - Lessons that take you through complete projects and illustrate what you can
    achieve by writing PyMedPhys-based Python software.
  - These are aimed at you if you don't yet know what you can achieve with
    PyMedPhys but you would like to learn.
|
- *How-to Guides*

  - Guides and recipes for common problems and tasks. These are aimed for you
    if you already know how to use Python and PyMedPhys and are looking for
    direction on a specific task you are trying to solve.
|
- *Reference*

  - Technical reference for the `library`_ (modules, functions and classes),
    as well as the available `command line tools`_. This is where you will find
    listed information for the exposed functionality of PyMedPhys.
  - This is aimed at you if you know exactly the feature you would like to use,
    you just want to see what inputs it requires and what outputs it gives.
|
- *Background*

  - Explanations and discussions of key topics and concepts. This is aimed at
    you if you are looking to be able to think about PyMedPhys and its
    implementations at a higher level and understand more about them.
