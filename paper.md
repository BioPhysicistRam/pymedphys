# Summary

PyMedPhys is an open-source medical physics Python library built by a community that values and prioritizes code sharing, review, 
improvement, and peer development. The overall goal of PyMedPhys is to provide medical physicists around the world with a library 
of software solutions to simplify and enhance their research and clinical work. It is inspired by the collaborative work of our 
physics peers in astronomy and the Astropy Project [@astropy].

# Statement of need

As the treatment delivery methods used in radiation oncology continue to improve, the complexity associated with ensuring precise 
and accurate delivery continues to increase. In response, many medical physicists are turning toward software solutions to help 
maximize efficiency and quality of care. It is common for medical physicists to develop their own in-house code for performing 
these tasks; many of which have been standardized through recommendations by organizations such as the American Association of Physicists 
in Medicine (AAPM). This can lead to the "reinvention of the wheel", where physicists are wasting time writing code to perform a 
function that someone else has already created. 

By creating and promoting an open-source repository, PyMedPhys aims to make the solutions physicists have created easily accessible
to others looking to do the same.
