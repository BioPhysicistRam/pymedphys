# Summary

PyMedPhys is an open-source medical physics Python library built by a community that values and prioritizes code
sharing, review, improvement, and peer development. The overall goal of PyMedPhys is to provide medical physicists
around the world with a free, open-source library of Python applications to simplify and enhance both their research and
clinical work. It is inspired by the collaborative work of our physics peers in astronomy and the Astropy
Project [@astropy].

# Statement of need

As the treatment delivery methods used in radiation oncology continue to improve, the complexity associated with
ensuring precise and accurate delivery continues to increase. In response, many medical physicists are turning toward
software solutions to help maximize efficiency and quality of care. It is common for medical physicists to develop their
own in-house code for performing these tasks; many of which have been standardized through recommendations by
organizations such as the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM). This can lead to the "reinvention of
the wheel", where physicists are wasting time writing code to perform a function that someone else has already created.

By creating and promoting an open-source repository, PyMedPhys aims to make the software solutions medical physicists
have created easily accessible to others. PyMedPhys is currently being implemented around the world for a handful of
applications[@galic2020method, pastor2021learning, rembish2021automating, rodriguez2020new, baltz2021validation, spezialetti2021using, tsuneda2021plastic, cronholm2020mri, milan2019evaluation, gajewski2021commissioning, lysakovski2021development].
